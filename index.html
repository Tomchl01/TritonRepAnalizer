Twin holds [POCKET JACKS] and faces a jam-or-fold decision.</li>
                                
                                <li>- Analysis: Twin’s 21bb stack makes this a high-frequency jam spot, but Antonius’s 3-bet range is polarized. Twin jams, and Antonius calls with [ACE-KING], creating a 4.5M pot (biggest of the final table).</li>

                                <li>- Turn/River: Queen pairs (Q♦), giving Antonius a better pair. Twin is eliminated, showcasing ICM pressure on short stacks.</li>

                                <li>- Turn: 6♣ (completing a straight for Vladimir’s T8). Vladimir [OVERBETS] 4.5M into 4.2M pot, risking Antonius folding. Antonius calls, drawing dead.</li>

                                <li>[00:00:03] - Boy Von defends a marginal hand (Jack-Five offsuit) from the big blind, sensing a post-flop edge against Corin. The flop comes Ace-9-5, giving Von bottom pair. Corin checks back, and the turn brings a five, giving Von trips. Corin checks again, and Von bets for value, building a significant pot. Corin calls, and the river completes a spade draw, but Von's trips hold up, securing a massive pot.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:04] - Tom flats with Ace-King in early position, a strategic decision likely aimed at keeping the pot controlled against aggressive opponents. This move is analyzed as a way to avoid escalating the pot preflop, especially with shorter stacks at the table.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:06] - Corin check-jams on the turn with a strong hand, creating a massive 9.1 million chip pot. This aggressive move puts Greenwood in a tough spot, who calls with an overpair. The turn card shifts the equity heavily in favor of Vladimir, leading to Greenwood's elimination. This hand is a pivotal moment, showcasing Corin's ability to apply pressure and capitalize on favorable runouts.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:08] - Dan Smith finds himself in a tricky spot with top pair against Corin's bottom two pair on a wet board. Smith checks, and Corin bets, forcing Smith to make a tough decision. Corin's aggressive play and board texture make this a high-pressure situation, highlighting the importance of hand reading and board awareness.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:10] - Fedor hits trip eights on the flop, trapping Smith into a large pot. Smith is unable to improve, and Fedor secures a significant chip boost. This hand demonstrates Fedor's ability to extract maximum value from strong hands.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:12] - Vladimir raises with King-Queen suited, and Kenny defends with pocket sixes. The flop brings two clubs, giving Vladimir a flush draw. The turn completes the flush, eliminating Kenny and further solidifying Vladimir's chip lead. This hand underscores the importance of position and hand selection in high-stakes situations.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:14] - Corin check-jams on the turn with a club draw, putting immense pressure on CA. CA calls with top pair, but the river completes Corin's flush, securing a massive pot and effectively ending the tournament. This hand is a defining moment, showcasing Corin's ability to leverage aggression and capitalize on favorable runouts.</li>

                                <li>[ALL-IN] and [ELIMINATION] - [19:20] Gavin andreanof goes all-in with 285k, the shortest stack in the field. He is called by andreanof, who covers him. Gavin shows nines and deuces, while andreanof has Aces. The board runs out, and Gavin doubles up, surviving the all-in.</li>
                                
                                <li>[BLUFF] and [CALL] - [20:01] Shining Don faces a pot-sized bet of 400k on the turn with a massive wrap and flush draw.

                                <li>[BLUFF] and [CALL] - [42:01] Phil Ivey faces a massive all-in from Ellis Parson with a set of sixes. Ivey tanks for a long time, considering the bounty aspect, but ultimately folds, showing the difficulty of calling in PLO with potential flush draws on the board.</li>
                                
                                <li>[ALL-IN] and [ELIMINATION] - [50:10] Phil Ivey is eliminated by Gavin andreanof in a hand where Ivey holds a set of sixes, but andreanof turns a flush.

                                <li>[BLUFF] and [CALL] - [54:40] Alex Foxen executes a well-timed bluff against Sam Greenwood, forcing Greenwood to fold his wrap and flush draw on the turn.

                                <li>[ALL-IN] and [ELIMINATION] - [55:00] Sam Greenwood is eliminated in 6th place after running his set of nines into Laro Guera's turned straight. Greenwood's elimination marks a pivotal moment as the final table narrows down.</li>

                                <li>### Key Poker Moments</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - Final Table Dynamics: The final table of the $25,000 Pot Limit Omaha (PLO) event is set with seven players remaining. Tom Axel Bedell is the chip leader with 7.1 million, followed by Richard Grio (5.2 million), Phil Ivey (3.7 million), and others. The short stacks are Eric Sidell (225,000) and Ellis Parson (550,000), who will be under significant ICM pressure as they navigate the final table.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - Phil Ivey's Presence: Phil Ivey, a poker legend with five Triton titles and over $14.5 million in Triton earnings, is a major threat at the table. Known for his versatility and ability to dominate in mixed games, Ivey is expected to leverage his experience in PLO to make deep runs.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - Richard Grio's PLO Expertise: Richard Grio, a renowned PLO specialist, is second in chips. His deep understanding of PLO dynamics makes him a formidable opponent, especially in a field with mixed experience levels.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - Short Stack Struggles: Eric Sidell and Ellis Parson are on short stacks (2 and 6 big blinds, respectively). Their survival will depend on finding the right spots to shove or double up, as they face ICM pressure with the pay jumps looming.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - Tom Axel Bedell's Aggression: As the chip leader, Bedell has been applying pressure on the table, entering many pots and forcing opponents to make tough decisions. His aggressive playstyle could lead to further accumulation of chips or potential confrontations with other big stacks like Grio and Ivey.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - Newcomers Shine: Shining Don and Ly Way, both from China, are making their first Triton final table appearances. Their performance against seasoned pros like Ivey and Grio will be a key storyline to watch.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - Final Table Strategy: With deep stacks and significant pay jumps, the final table is expected to be a mix of cautious play and strategic aggression. The short stacks will look to double up early, while the chip leaders will aim to isolate and eliminate the smaller stacks to secure their positions.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:14:40] - ICM Considerations: The ICM pressure will be a significant factor, especially for the middle stacks like Ivey and Grio, who will need to balance aggression with the risk of busting before the pay jumps. The short stacks, Sidell and Parson, will be looking for all-in opportunities to survive and climb the payout ladder.</li>

                                <li>### Key Poker Moments</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:28] - Final Table Dynamics and Early Hands</li>
                                
                                <li>- Final Table Setup: The final table of the $150K Triton Super High Roller begins with 8 players. João Vieira is the chip leader with 5.2 million chips, followed by Alex Ponakov (3.35M) and Fedor Holz (3.1M). The payouts are massive, with $4.6M for the champion and six players guaranteed $1M+.</li>
                                
                                <li>- Early ICM Pressure: Players are cautious due to the significant pay jumps. Alex Foxen, the shortest stack with 1.6M (17 big blinds), navigates carefully, knowing he has two pay jumps ahead.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:32] - João Vieira's Dominance</li>
                                
                                <li>- Vieira's Aggression: Vieira, the chip leader, uses his stack to apply pressure. He 3-bets and flats in position, making it difficult for shorter stacks to play back. His aggressive style is evident as he bluffs Dan Smith off King-Jack on a 9-6-3 board, showcasing his ability to leverage ICM pressure.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:38] - Fedor Holz vs. Alex Foxen</li>
                                
                                <li>- All-In Showdown: Fedor Holz (pocket eights) faces Alex Foxen (Queen-Ten suited) in a crucial hand. Foxen flops a queen, and despite Holz picking up a flush draw on the turn, Foxen holds to double up. This hand leaves Fedor with less than 10 big blinds, putting him in a precarious position.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:47] - Fedor Holz Eliminated</li>
                                
                                <li>- Fedor's Exit: Fedor Holz is eliminated in 7th place after his pocket eights run into Wong Ye's Queen-Eight. Fedor fails to improve, and Wong's queen holds, sending Fedor home with $595,000. This marks Fedor's 29th Triton cash, but he remains stuck on four Triton titles.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:54] - Ding Bow Eliminated</li>
                                
                                <li>- Ding Bow's Exit: Ding Bow is eliminated in 6th place after his Ten-Ten runs into Alex Ponakov's Queen-Queen. Ding fails to improve, and Ponakov's queens hold, sending Ding home with $807,000. This hand solidifies Ponakov's position as a strong contender for the title.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:59] - Alex Foxen Eliminated</li>
                                
                                <li>- Foxen's Exit: Alex Foxen is eliminated in 5th place after his Ten-Ten runs into Kat Lee's Ace-King. Foxen fails to improve, and Lee's ace-high holds, sending Foxen home with $1.17M. Despite being the shortest stack, Foxen secured multiple pay jumps, showcasing his resilience.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [1:02:45] - Kat Lee Eliminated</li>
                                
                                <li>- Kat Lee's Exit: Kat Lee is eliminated in 4th place after his Ace-King runs into Alex Ponakov's Seven-Seven. Ponakov flops a set, and Lee fails to improve, sending him home with $1.37M. Lee, often regarded as one of the best without a Triton title, falls short once again.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [1:10:12] - Dan Smith Eliminated</li>
                                
                                <li>- Dan Smith's Exit: Dan Smith is eliminated in 3rd place after his Ace-Jack runs into Wong Ye's Ace-Ten. Smith fails to improve, and Wong's ten-high holds, sending Smith home with $1.78M. Smith's deep run adds to his impressive Triton resume.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [1:22:45] - Heads-Up Play: Alex Ponakov vs. João Vieira</li>
                                
                                <li>- Heads-Up Battle: The final two players, Alex Ponakov and João Vieira, battle for the title. Ponakov, with a slight chip lead, continues to apply pressure, while Vieira looks to leverage his experience and aggression to secure his first Triton title.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [1:30:00] - Final Hand</li>
                                
                                <li>- Ponakov's Victory: In the final hand, Alex Ponakov secures the title after his Queen-Queen holds against João Vieira's King-Nine. Vieira fails to improve, and Ponakov claims the $4.6M first-place prize, marking his first Triton title.</li>
                                
                                <li>### Key Poker Moments</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=10867" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:01:07]</a> #### [03:01:07] - Table Dynamics and ICM Pressure</li>
                                
                                <li>- Middle Stack Woes: João Vieira is handcuffed as the middle stack, with Wong Ye short-stacked, limiting Vieira's ability to play aggressively. Alex Ponakov (Pacov) exploits this by limping with weak hands, forcing Vieira to play cautiously.</li>
                                
                                <li>- Monotone Board: Pacov checks back on a monotone board with Ace-high, while Wong Ye holds bottom pair with a flush draw. Pacov’s tendency to fold on such textures is noted, but Wong Ye sticks around, leading to a bet-call of 200k.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=10922" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:02:02]</a> #### [03:02:02] - Thin Value and Board Dynamics</li>
                                
                                <li>- Thin Value Bet: Pacov finds thin value on a 6-5-3 board, betting 250k on the river with bottom pair. Wong Ye folds, showcasing Pacov’s ability to extract value in marginal spots, a key skill in high-stakes poker.</li>
                                
                                <li>- ICM Pressure: With three players remaining, each big blind is worth significantly more, and Pacov’s willingness to go for thin value repeatedly pays off, chipping away at Vieira and Wong Ye.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=11101" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:05:01]</a> #### [03:05:01] - Vieira’s Struggles</li>
                                
                                <li>- Handcuffed Play: Vieira is in a tough spot, out of position against Pacov, who continues to apply pressure. Vieira is forced to play passively, bleeding chips slowly as Pacov dominates the action.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=11171" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:06:11]</a> #### [03:06:11] - Vieira’s Passive Play</li>
                                
                                <li>- Check-Back: Vieira checks back with Queen-Ten on a Queen-10-5 board, opting for passive play to avoid confrontations with Pacov. This passive strategy is a result of ICM pressure and Pacov’s aggressive tendencies.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=11643" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:14:03]</a> #### [03:14:03] - Pacov’s Controlled Aggression</li>
                                
                                <li>- Thin Value Mastery: Pacov continues to apply controlled aggression, chipping away at Vieira and Wong Ye. His ability to find value in marginal spots and avoid overcommitting keeps him in control of the table dynamics.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=11942" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:19:02]</a> #### [03:19:02] - Vieira’s Attempt to Fight Back</li>
                                
                                <li>- Lead Bet: Vieira breaks protocol with a lead bet on a King-7-5 board, trying to chip up and regain some control. However, Pacov’s consistent pressure keeps Vieira on the defensive.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=12165" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:22:45]</a> #### [03:22:45] - Wong Ye’s Double-Up</li>
                                
                                <li>- Double-Up Opportunity: Wong Ye finds a double-up with King-Deuce against Vieira’s King-Five. The hand showcases Wong Ye’s resilience despite being card-dead for much of the final table.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=12606" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:30:06]</a> #### [03:30:06] - Vieira’s Comeback</li>
                                
                                <li>- Key Hand: Vieira wins a crucial pot with Queen-Jack against Pacov’s King-Five, chipping up and narrowing the gap between the two leaders. This hand shifts the momentum slightly in Vieira’s favor.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=13500" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:45:00]</a> #### [03:45:00] - Wong Ye’s Second Double-Up</li>

                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=14100" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[03:55:00]</a> #### [03:55:00] - Wong Ye’s Exit</li>
                                
                                <li>- Elimination: Wong Ye is eliminated in 3rd place after his Ace-Jack runs into Pacov’s Queen-Jack. Despite a valiant effort, Wong Ye’s card-dead run ends with a $2M+ payday.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=14400" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[04:00:00]</a> #### [04:00:00] - Heads-Up Play: Vieira vs. Pacov</li>
                                
                                <li>- Heads-Up Battle: The final two players, João Vieira and Alex Ponakov, battle for the title. Both players are evenly stacked, setting the stage for a high-stakes duel.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=15600" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[04:20:00]</a> #### [04:20:00] - Final Hand</li>
                                
                                <li>- Cooler: In the final hand, Vieira’s Ace-Jack flops a jack against Pacov’s Ace-Queen, but the river brings a queen, giving Pacov the pot and the chip lead. Vieira is left with less than 10 big blinds, and Pacov eventually secures the title.</li>
                                
                                <li>### Key Poker Moments</li>

                                <li>- Daniel Doris makes a disciplined fold on the turn after seeing a King, likely believing he had the best hand. The river pairs the board, and Doris checks through, showing restraint in a tricky spot.</li>
                                
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nf6WWxn1Bt4&t=21165" target="_blank" class="highlighted-timestamp">[05:52:45]</a> #### [05:52:45] - Lucas Greenwood vs. David Yan: [ALL-IN]</li>
                                
                                <li>- Lucas Greenwood raises on the button with King-Jack suited, and David Yan shoves from the big blind.

                                <li>[00:00:10] - Fedor Holtz opens with pocket Tens from the button, a strong position. Alex Foxen 3-bets with Queen-Ten suited, but Fedor is a significant favorite (better than 3:2). The flop brings a Queen, giving Foxen top pair, but Fedor has a flush draw. The turn and river fail to improve Fedor's hand, and Foxen takes the pot.</li>

                                <li>[00:00:14] - Wong makes a remarkable comeback, doubling up twice with marginal hands, including King-Deuce against Vieira’s top two pair. Wong’s aggressive play and timely cards keep him alive.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:15] - Pacov and Vieira clash in a pivotal hand. Pacov jams with middle pair on a King-high board, but Vieira calls with top pair, securing a massive pot and solidifying his chip lead.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:16] - Vieira wins the tournament after a heads-up battle with Pacov. Vieira’s Ace-Queen holds against Pacov’s Ace-Jack, securing him the title and a $4.61 million prize.</li>

                                <li>### Key Poker Moments</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:13:07] - Patrick Antonius makes a significant move with Ace Queen against kale Burns' Queen Jack. Despite being a huge favorite, Antonius loses the hand when Burns hits a backdoor heart draw and a gutshot straight on the turn and river, respectively. This hand is a pivotal moment as Antonius loses a substantial pot, showcasing the volatility of high-stakes poker.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:13:07] - Wong with pocket sixes faces Sam Greenwood's pocket kings in a 3-bet pot. Wong flops a set and check-calls Greenwood's bets on the flop and turn. On the river, Wong jams, and Greenwood calls, only to see Wong's set. This hand is a massive pot win for Wong, solidifying his chip lead and eliminating Greenwood, who was the second-biggest stack at the table.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:13:07] - Patrick Antonius is involved in another critical hand, this time with 10-9 offsuit against Mike Watson's Queen Jack. Antonius flops top two pair, but Watson hits a queen on the river to win the pot. This hand further adds to Antonius' frustration as he continues to face tough beats.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:13:07] - Shaman O'Dwyer eliminates Tom Fuchs in a dramatic hand where Fuchs flops a pair with Queen Deuce, but O'Dwyer hits Ace Queen runner-runner to make a better pair. This hand is notable for O'Dwyer's comeback and the elimination of Fuchs, who had been a short stack.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:13:07] - Patrick Antonius makes a bold bluff with five-high against Phil Ivey's Ace-high. Antonius check-calls the flop and turn, then bets big on the river, forcing Ivey to fold. This hand highlights Antonius' ability to read his opponents and make high-level bluffs in critical spots.</li>

                                <li>[00:00:03] - Michael Watson faces a critical decision with pocket Tens against Mario Mosbach's Ace-King.

Watson is eliminated shortly after, finishing in 7th place for $375,000.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:04] - Mario Mosbach secures a huge double-up after winning the pot against Watson. This hand significantly boosts Mosbach's stack and momentum heading into the later stages of the tournament.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:05] - Brandon Wilson, one of the shorter stacks, makes a bold shove with King-Ten offsuit from the hijack. He is called by Dylan Lindy in the big blind with Ace-Jack. Wilson fails to improve and is eliminated in 6th place, taking home $500,000.</li>

                                <li>[00:00:09] - Heads-Up Play begins between Mario Mosbach and Bryn Kenney. Mosbach gains a significant chip lead after a series of well-played hands, including a bluff on the river with Ace-high that Kenney calls with King-high. This hand shifts the momentum heavily in Mosbach's favor.</li>

                                <li>[00:00:03] - Kale Burns faces a critical decision with 19 big blinds after a button and cutoff open. He calls instead of shoving, likely due to the bounty format influencing his decision. The flop comes with top pair, king kicker for Burns, while I Binger holds a nut flush draw with an ace overcard. Burns jams, and Binger snap-calls, collecting the bounty and eliminating Burns in 8th place.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:06] - Makita Bikowski leads on a 3-6-4 two hearts flop with 6-5 of clubs, considering the bounty value. He opts for a check-raise strategy, balancing his range between bluffs and strong hands. This aggressive play is driven by the potential to win both the pot and the bounty.</li>

                                <li>[00:00:12] - Shawn Winter executes a check-raise on a Q-10-7 board, leveraging his strong hand (top two pair) to maximize value.

Binger collects another bounty, further cementing his status as the Bounty King with 10.5 bounties.</li>

                                <li>[00:00:31] - Shawn Winter secures his first Triton Super High Roller title after a heads-up battle with Makita Bikowski. Winter’s A-6 holds against Makita’s J-6 suited, marking a career-defining moment for Winter.</li>

                                <li>#### [00:00:03] - Final Table Dynamics and Early Action</li>
                                
                                <li>- Justin folds pocket tens under pressure, highlighting the tight play at the final table.</li>
                                
                                <li>- John Ander faces an early position open with Q♠️Q♦️ and decides to 3-BET all-in for 8 big blinds, a standard move given his stack size and hand strength.</li>
                                
                                <li>- Calvin Lee calls the all-in with A♠️Q♠️, a strong hand but behind John’s queens. Calvin’s equity is 43%, and he’s hoping to hit an ace or queen. The board runs out dry, and Calvin is eliminated, marking the first exit at the final table.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:04] - Orin’s Aggressive 3-Bet and Calvin’s Response</li>
                                
                                <li>- Orin 3-bets to 2.5 million from the button, a smaller sizing that leaves room for Calvin to 4-BET all-in with A♠️9♠️. Calvin’s move is a FORCED ALL-IN due to stack sizes, and Orin calls with pocket tens. The board runs out 5♦️4♦️2♠️, favoring Orin’s tens, and Calvin is eliminated in 8th place.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:07] - Misclick Drama and Momentum Shift</li>
                                
                                <li>- Calvin Lee misclicks preflop, leading to an unexpected ALL-IN with A♠️9♠️. Pascal Fedor calls with K♠️J♠️, and the board runs out Q♠️J♦️8♦️, giving Pascal the lead. Calvin fails to improve, and the misclick costs him a significant pot, shifting momentum to Pascal.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:11] - Coleman’s Tough Spot with Pocket Sixes</li>
                                
                                <li>- Coleman faces a 3-BET from Yarvi with 6♠️6♦️. Coleman jams all-in, but Yarvi calls with pocket nines. The board runs out 5♦️3♦️2♠️, giving Coleman an overpair and a gutshot, but Yarvi’s nines hold, eliminating Coleman in a crucial pot.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:16] - Filov’s Bluff and Fedor’s Call</li>
                                
                                <li>- Filov bets aggressively on an A♠️Q♦️10♠️ board, putting Fedor to the test with A♠️6♦️. Fedor calls, but the turn and river bring no help, and Filov’s top pair holds, eliminating Fedor in a high-stakes pot.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:23] - Filov’s Bold Bluff Against CBA</li>
                                
                                <li>- Filov bluffs aggressively with Q♠️5♦️ on a 5♠️9♦️J♠️ board, forcing CBA to fold Q♠️J♦️. Filov’s bold play pays off, showcasing his ability to apply pressure and exploit fold equity.</li>

                                <li>- Calvin Lee eliminates Yarvi with A♠️K♦️ against K♠️10♦️. The board runs out J♠️6♦️3♠️, and Calvin’s ace-high holds, further solidifying his chip lead.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:28] - Final Hand: Calvin Lee vs. Anatoli Filov</li>
                                
                                <li>- Calvin Lee jams with A♠️K♦️, and Anatoli Filov calls with K♠️9♦️. The board runs out Q♠️8♦️5♠️, and Calvin’s ace-high holds, securing the victory and the $1.188 million first-place prize.</li>

                                <li>#### [00:00:02] - Alejandro Loko's Mystery Hand and Strategic Play</li>
                                
                                <li>- Alejandro Loko makes a cheeky [3-BET] to 2.7 million, creating a mystery hand scenario. The flop comes Queen-8-2 with two clubs. Loko, holding a disconnected hand, decides to [BET] 25% of the pot, leveraging his range advantage on this board. Ben Heath, with a seven, calls, and the turn brings a club, which Heath blocks. Loko continues with a sizable [BET] of half the pot, putting pressure on Heath. The river sees Loko leading again, and Heath, after a long tank, [CALLS] with a bluff catcher. Loko reveals trip Queens, a strong value hand, and takes down the pot, leaving Heath with just four big blinds.</li>

                                <li>- Loko [3-BETS] with Aces, a move that commentators note is likely to isolate and avoid multi-way pots. This aggressive play pays off as Loko's opponent folds, allowing him to chip up without showdown.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:13] - Loko's Double Gutter and Rivered Nut Straight</li>
                                
                                <li>- In a blind vs. blind situation, Loko faces TVD with a double gutter draw on an 8-6-4 board. TVD hits top pair on the turn, but Loko continues to [BET] aggressively. The river brings the 9 of Spades, completing Loko's nut straight. He [ALL-IN] shoves, and TVD, with top pair, is forced to [CALL]. Loko's rivered straight secures a massive pot, further solidifying his chip lead.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:17] - Loko's Full House Eliminates Devoris</li>
                                
                                <li>- Loko [RAISES] with Jacks, and Devoris [CALLS] with Deuces. The flop brings a Jack, giving Loko top set. Devoris, needing running deuces, fails to improve, and Loko makes a full house on the river, eliminating Devoris and further extending his chip lead.</li>
                                
                                <li>#### [00:00:19] - Heath's Final Stand Against Loko</li>
                                
                                <li>- Ben Heath, short-stacked, goes [ALL-IN] with Ace-King against Loko's King-Deuce. The flop brings a deuce, giving Loko a pair.

                                <li>[00:00:03] - Texas Mike is eliminated after a [TRAP] by Zubov. Mike goes [ALL-IN] with King-3 offsuit against Zubov’s pocket Queens. The Queens hold, and Mike loses 1.4 million chips, leaving him with just a big blind. This hand highlights the dangers of aggressive play against a well-executed trap.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:03] - Phil Ivy faces a critical decision against Texas Mike on a paired board with Queen-4 offsuit. Ivy considers calling a large bet but ultimately [FOLDS], showcasing the difficulty of playing against a chip-leading, aggressive opponent. The Queen of Hearts in Ivy’s hand complicates his decision, as it blocks some flush draws but also reduces the likelihood of Mike bluffing.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:09] - Texas Mike makes an ill-timed [3-BET] jam with Queen-8 against Ben Heath’s pocket Jacks. Heath calls, and Mike fails to hit his outs, resulting in his elimination. This hand demonstrates the high-stakes nature of final table play and the importance of timing in shoving decisions.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:12] - Daniel Voris and Jang clash in a massive [ALL-IN] pot for 27.5 million chips. Voris holds Ace-King against Jang’s King-Queen. The board runs out favorably for Voris, and he secures a dominant chip lead with 37 million chips, nearly 40% of the total chips in play. This hand significantly shifts the momentum of the final table.</li>
                                
                                <li>[00:00:15] - Daniel Voris continues his dominance, eliminating Ponop with pocket Aces against Ponop’s suited Ace. Voris now controls half the chips in play, solidifying his position as the chip leader. This hand underscores the importance of premium hands in high-stakes situations.</li>
